Analysis of US Cencus 1990 data using various unsupervised techniques, like clustering and anomaly detection.
Clustering techniques are frequently used to analyze census data and obtain meaningfullarge scale groups.  
some of the most used techniques are k-means, DBSCAN, GMM, MeanShift, Spectral clustering and Hierarchical clustering algorithm.  
In recent years, similartasks has been done frequently.  Nevertheless, evaluation studies comparing all of thoseapproaches  are  rare  and  usually  inconclusive.   
In  this  paper  an  experimental  approachto this problem is adopted.  
Using the US 1990 data set, we compared all of the aboveclustering methods and concluded that the most appropriate method for this informationis k-means.  
In addition, during the article we will look at the effect of external variableslike  age,  sex,  origin,  and  Yearwrk.   
We  have  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the  externalvariable which connects to the clusters in the best way is Yearwrk.  
Finally, we examineabnormal  samples,  show  their  low  association  with  external  variables,  and  present  theinformation divided 
into clusters using the cluster method we selected and visualise theclusters associated with the external variables.
